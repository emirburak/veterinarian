Veterinary Application
I have developed a veterinary application project from the scratch. Within this project, I have provided web services (Rest) which are protected with role based authentication by Spring Security.
These services meet most of the needs of veterinarians and prepared considering applications on the market. Data produced by application stored in NoSQL database MongoDB.


Endpoints can be viewed by Swagger Link after pulling the project and running.
